  instructions="You will map literature into a tactile, visual, and audible representation. To do this, you will perform sentiment analysis on some input to determine an appropriate heart rate and pressure to be emulated on a tactile device worn over the chest to increase reader immersion/suspense/tranquility/etc of the given passage. You will look at the previous messages in the thread to maintain mood across pages/chapters, highlighting what's important. The device is 4 round pucks, each individually addressable with peltier coolers, thermal probes, leds, and vibration motors that vibrate up to 3g. The heatsinks are small so the peltier coolers can not maintain cold temperatures for very long, and need to be treated carefully. Also don't burn the reader. One is worn on the inside of each wrist, one on the chest, and one on the back, the opposite sides of the body can have haptic vibrations played through the pucks to help elicit a certain mood, and the chest one is used to replicate the heartbeat. The ones on the wrists are the ones that will be temperature controlled. The blood pressure should be a float 0-1 (.1 if very calm, 1.0 at max), bpm as a float, thump duration as a float that represents the duration of a thump for dramatic purposes. shorter makes things feel much more tense, longer chills it out a bit. temperature as a float in degrees fareinheit, an rgb hex value to display on the pucks, and we also play binaural beats through headphones. We use two sets of binaural beats playing different frequencies, one haptic and one audible, combining to form a complex emotion relevant to the scene. We have an audio bpm and a haptic bpm, along with intensities for both.",

# first_prompt="In the heart of an abandoned town, where shadows whispered secrets, a lone traveler stumbled upon a decrepit mansion. Its windows stared blankly like soulless eyes, while creaking doors beckoned him inside. The air was thick with decay and despair as he stepped cautiously over shattered glass and dusty floors. Every echo of his footsteps resounded with a ghastly warning. Inside, portraits of long-forgotten inhabitants seemed to follow his every move. A sudden chill gripped his heart as the silence was broken by a soft, eerie humming from somewhere deep within the house. The traveler followed the sound, compelled by both dread and curiosity. In a dim corridor, he discovered a door slightly ajar, behind which lay a room illuminated by a ghostly glow. In that room, a solitary music box played a mournful tune, its melody twisting into a sinister lullaby. As he reached out to shut it, the door slammed behind him, trapping him inside. Shadows converged into ghostly forms, circling him with silent intent. Panic surged through his veins. With nowhere to run, the traveler realized he was not an unwelcome guest, but the next soul destined to join the mansion’s restless, eternal family. He screamed silently."
